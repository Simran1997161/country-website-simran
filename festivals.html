    <h2>Holi</h2>
    <div class="container-card">
    <p>Holi, often referred to as the "Festival of Colors", is one of the best known festivals outside of India. The festival is centered around the burning and destruction of the demoness Holika, which was made possible through unwavering devotion to Lord Vishnu. However, the really fun part involves people throwing colored powder on each other and squirting each other with water guns. This is associated with Lord Krishna, a reincarnation of Lord Vishnu, who liked to play pranks on the village girls by drenching them in water and colors. Bhang (a paste made from cannabis plants) is also traditionally consumed during the celebrations. Holi is a very carefree festival that's great fun to participate in if you dont mind getting wet and dirty. </p>

    <h2>Vaisakhi</h2>
    <div class="container-card">
    <p>Vaisakhi, also pronounced Baisakhi as well as Basoa (among Dogras),[9] marks the first day of the month of Vaisakh and is traditionally celebrated annually on 13 April and sometimes 14 April.[10][3][11] It is seen as a spring harvest celebration primarily in Punjab and Northern India.[12] </p>

    <p>For Sikhs, in addition to its significance as the harvest festival,[4] during which Sikhs hold kirtans, visit local gurdwaras, community fairs, hold nagar kirtan processions, raise the Nishan Sahib flag, and gather to socialize and share festive foods,[3][19][20] Vaisakhi observes major events in the history of Sikhism and the Indian subcontinent that happened in the Punjab region.[19][21] Vaisakhi as a major Sikh festival marks the birth of the Khalsa order by Guru Gobind Singh, the tenth Guru of Sikhism, on 13 April 1699.[22][23][24] Later, Ranjit Singh was proclaimed as Maharaja of the Sikh Empire on 12 April 1801 (to coincide with Vaisakhi), creating a unified political state.  </p>

    <h2>Gurpurab </h2>
    <p>The birthday of Guru Nanak, the founder of the Sikh religion, comes in the month of November, but the date varies from year to year according to the lunar Indian calendar. The birthday celebrations last three days. Generally two days before the birthday, Akhand Path is performed in the Gurdwaras. One day before the birthday, a procession is organised which is led by the Panj Piare and the Palki (Palanquin) of Guru Granth Sahib and followed by teams of singers singing hymns, brass bands playing different tunes, 'Gatka' (martial art) teams show their swordsmanship, and processionists singing the chorus. The procession passes through the main roads and streets of the town which are covered with buntings and decorated gates and the leaders inform the people of the message of Guru Nanak. On the anniversary day, the programme begins early in the morning at about 4 or 5 am with the singing of Asa di Var (morning hymns) and hymns from the Sikh scriptures followed by Katha (exposition of the scripture) and lectures and recitation of poems in praise of the Guru. The celebrations go on till about 2 pm. </p>

    <h2>Temple Festivals in Kerala </h2>
